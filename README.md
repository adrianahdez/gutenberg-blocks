## How we reuse React Components in dynamic blocks

We build our dynamic blocks as a React component that isn't aware of Gutenberg. That block accepts a prop that is used to pass block attributes. But for now, Gutenberg only allow to render the dynamic blocks using PHP. 
So, to be able to reuse the same React Component that we have in the Edit function we based on [this article from WooCommerce](https://developer.woocommerce.com/2021/11/15/how-does-woocommerce-blocks-render-interactive-blocks-in-the-frontend/). 

And what we do basically is:

* When the post or page is saved, only an empty `div` element with an ID or class is saved to the Database.
* In the PHP `render_callback`, we append the block attributes as `data-` HTML attributes to that `div`. So this is what ends up being rendered in the page.
* We enqueue a new `frontend.js` file which will import the React component.
* From there, we just need to render the React component as you would render any other React app: `render(BlockComponent, divElement)`. We read `data-` HTML attributes and pass them as props to the component.
